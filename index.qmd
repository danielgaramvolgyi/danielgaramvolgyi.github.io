My name is [Dániel Garamvölgyi]{.my-name}.^[You can safely disregard the accent in my forename and just call me Daniel.
My surname is tricky, and I don't mind if you mispronounce it. If you want to, you can <a href=https://forvo.com/word/garamv%C3%B6lgyi/ target="_blank">listen to the correct pronunciation on forvo</a>.]\
I am a [mathematician]{.my-name}.

I recently defended my PhD at [ELTE](https://www.math.elte.hu/en/) (Budapest, Hungary).\
Currently, I am a **predoctoral fellow** at the [Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics](https://www.renyi.hu/en).
I will also serve as a **semester postdoc** at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/) from late January until early May. 

My primary research area is **combinatorial rigidity theory**.\
Somewhat reductively, it is about a family of particularly interesting matroids, equipped with a particularly interesting representation.
It is an area that can be studied using a wide variety of tools, both geometric and combinatorial. It also has many applications within and outside of mathematics.

More broadly, I am interested in **graph theory**, **matroid theory**, and **algebraic geometry**, as well as the interplay between them. In particular, I like to study certain geometric problems by looking at them through the lens of matroid theory.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking in the mountains, playing and writing music, books, movies, etc.
