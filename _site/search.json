    "text": "My name is Dániel Garamvölgyi.1\nI am a mathematician.\nI recently defended my PhD at ELTE (Budapest, Hungary).\nCurrently, I am a predoctoral fellow at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics. I will also serve as a semester postdoc at ICERM from late January until early May.\nMy primary research area is combinatorial rigidity theory.\nSomewhat reductively, it is about a family of particularly interesting matroids, equipped with a particularly interesting representation. It is an area that can be studied using a wide variety of tools, both geometric and combinatorial. It also has many applications within and outside of mathematics.\nMore broadly, I am interested in graph theory, matroid theory, and algebraic geometry, as well as the interplay between them. In particular, I like to study certain geometric problems by looking at them through the lens of matroid theory.\nOutside of mathematics, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking in the mountains, playing and writing music, books, movies, etc.\nFeel free to contact me: daniel.garamvolgyi@ttk.elte.hu"
